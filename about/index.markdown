## About me

Hi, I'm James Brainard, 

This website is essentially my semi-professional portfolio. Here you can find all of the cool things that I know, have done, and am doing.

Most of the projects, experiences, research topics, etc. on this page have their own article where I explore them more in-depth. Articles include figures, explanation, code, and more.

## Background & Education

I didn't learn how to program properly until my second year of college. In middle school, it was always Scratch from MIT. I still insist - in my unbiased opinion - that block-based learning tools are the best way to learn how to code.

I entered college having planned to study math for years; I changed my major the second day of school. For a few semesters, I wandered around picking up classes I thought were interesting. I ended up declaring a major in Psychology my second semester of college, and a second major in Data Science my fourth semester. I had just enough business classes finished during my first year to pick up a minor in Business Administration as well.

Having such a diversified educational background, to me, is a huge help. I learned what neural networks were in psychology classes before I learned about them in data science classes. But it always leads to the same question - "*what do you want to do with that?*"

I don't know yet - but I'm much closer to an answer than I was three years ago!
